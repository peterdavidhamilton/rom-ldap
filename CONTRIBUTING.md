# Issue Guidelines

## Reporting bugs

If you found a bug, report an issue and describe what's the expected behavior 
versus what actually happens. If the bug causes a crash, attach a full backtrace. 
If possible, a reproduction script showing the problem is highly appreciated.

## Help wanted

If you have experience of ROM and LDAP and can contribute to this project your 
contributions are very welcome. Functionality like secure connections and transactions 
are still to be implemented.

## Asking for help

If you need help getting started and the documentation is lacking you can try 
emailing me at peter[at]pdhamilton.uk.
