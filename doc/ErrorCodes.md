| 1      | LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR               | Indicates an internal error. The server is unable to respond with a more specific error and is also unable to properly respond to a request. It does not indicate that the client has sent an erroneous message. In NDS 8.3x through NDS 7.xx, this was the default error for NDS errors that did not map to an LDAP error code. To conform to the new LDAP drafts, NDS 8.5 uses 80 (0x50) for such errors.                                                                                                                          |

| 51     | LDAP_BUSY                           | Indicates that the LDAP server is too busy to process the client request at this time but if the client waits and resubmits the request, the server may be able to process it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52     | LDAP_UNAVAILABLE                    | Indicates that the LDAP server cannot process the client's bind request, usually because it is shutting down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This error is returned for the following reasons: The add entry request violates the server's structure rules...OR...The modify attribute request specifies attributes that users cannot modify...OR...Password restrictions prevent the action...OR...Connection restrictions prevent the action.                                                                                                                                 |
| 54     | LDAP_LOOP_DETECT                    | Indicates that the client discovered an alias or referral loop, and is thus unable to complete this request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 64     | LDAP_NAMING_VIOLATION               | Indicates that the add or modify DN operation violates the schema's structure rules. For example, The request places the entry subordinate to an alias. The request places the entry subordinate to a container that is forbidden by the containment rules. The RDN for the entry uses a forbidden attribute type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 65     | LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION         | Indicates that the add, modify, or modify DN operation violates the object class rules for the entry. For example, the following types of request return this error: The add or modify operation tries to add an entry without a value for a required attribute. The add or modify operation tries to add an entry with a value for an attribute which the class definition does not contain. The modify operation tries to remove a required attribute without removing the auxiliary class that defines the attribute as required. |
| 66     | LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF         | Indicates that the requested operation is permitted only on leaf entries. For example, the following types of requests return this error: The client requests a delete operation on a parent entry. The client request a modify DN operation on a parent entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 67     | LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN             | Indicates that the modify operation attempted to remove an attribute value that forms the entry's relative distinguished name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 68     | LDAP_ALREADY_EXISTS                 | Indicates that the add operation attempted to add an entry that already exists, or that the modify operation attempted to rename an entry to the name of an entry that already exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
