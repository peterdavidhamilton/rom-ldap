    # 0x31
    # 49
    # LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS: Indicates during a bind operation one of the following occurred:
    # The client passed either an incorrect DN or password.
    # The password is incorrect because it has expired, intruder detection has locked the account, or some other similar reason.

    # 0x32
    # 50
    # LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS: Indicates the caller does not have sufficient rights to perform the requested operation.

    # 0x33
    # 51

    # 0x34
    # 52
    # LDAP_UNAVAILABLE: Indicates the LDAP server cannot process the client's bind request, usually because it is shutting down.

    # 0x35
    # 53
    # LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM: Indicates the LDAP server cannot process the request because of server-defined restrictions. This error is returned for the following reasons:
    # The add entry request violates the server's structure rules.
    # The modify attribute request specifies attributes that users cannot modify.
    # Password restrictions prevent the action.
    # Connection restrictions prevent the action.

    # 0x36

    # 0x41
    # 65
    # LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION: Indicates the add, modify, or modify DN operation violates the object class rules for the entry. For example, the following types of request return this error:
    # The add or modify operation tries to add an entry without a value for a required attribute.
    # The add or modify operation tries to add an entry with a value for an attribute which the class definition does not contain.
    # The modify operation tries to remove a required attribute without removing the auxiliary class that defines the attribute as required.

    # 0x42
    # 66
    # LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF: Indicates the requested operation is permitted only on leaf entries. For example, the following types of requests return this error:

    # 0x43
    # 67
    # LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN: Indicates the modify operation attempted to remove an attribute value that forms the entry's relative distinguished name.

    # 0x44
    # 68
    # LDAP_ALREADY_EXISTS: Indicates the add operation attempted to add an entry that already exists, or that the modify operation attempted to rename an entry to the name of an entry that already exists.

    # LDAP_OTHER: Indicates an unknown error condition. This is the default value for NDS error codes which do not map to other LDAP error codes.
